## Whack-a-Block

The game you are going to create is called "Whack-a-Block", inspired by the original arcade game ["Whac-a-Mole"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole). The objective of the game is to whack (or hit with a sword) the blocks that light up as glowstone, and turn them back to stone. You will earn points for each block you turn back to stone and the game is over when all the blocks have been turned into glowstone.

To create this game you're going to need to use Minecraft Pi Edition on the Raspberry Pi, and the Python 3 programming environment IDLE.
