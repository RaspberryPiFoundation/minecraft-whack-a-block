## What next?

This might be the end of the worksheet, but it doesn't have to be the end of the game.  

At the moment the gameplay is pretty simple, and there's a lot you can do, now you have the basic program set up, to make it your own. Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. The difficulty of the game is set by the how long the program waits before lighting another block, currently `time.sleep(0.2)`. By increasing this time you make the game easier, and decreasing it will make the game harder. Experiment and see what works best for you.

1. What if the player gets things wrong and hits a stone block instead of a glowstone block? Can you change the program so that if the player hits a stone block, it lights the block? This forces the player to think more about what block they are hitting and increases the skill required.

1. It is common for video games to start easy and get harder. Can you make the game start easier and the more points you score, the harder it gets?
