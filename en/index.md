# Minecraft Whack A Mole

Minecraft is a popular sandbox open-world building game. A free version of Minecraft is available for the Raspberry Pi; it also comes with a programming interface. This means you can write commands and scripts in Python code to build things in the game automatically. It's a great way to learn Python!  

## Whac-a-Block

The game you are going to create is called "Whac-a-Block", inspired by the original arcade game ["Whac-a-Mole"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole). The objective of the game is to whack (or hit with a sword) the blocks that light up as glowstone, and turn them back to stone. You will earn points for each block you turn back to stone and the game is over when all the blocks have been turned into glowstone.

This project is split into five parts.

1. Create the program: starting your Minecraft Python program and making sure everything is working.
2. Build the game board: creating the code which will make game board appear in front of the player.
3. Turn the blocks on: coding the functions to turn the blocks randomly into glowstone.
4. Whack blocks: turn the blocks back to stone when the player hits them.
5. Game over: how many points did you score?
